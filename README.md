js-model-viewer
===============

A simple webapp that uses WebGL to view STL and OBJ files.

Click and drag to rotate the camera around the model. Right click to
roll. Hold CTRL to rotate the model instead of the camera.

Currently supported formats:
* Binary STL
* ASCII STL

TODO:
* Add OBJ support
* Add UI
* Camera modes
* Lines indicating the three axes

Maybe:
* Support for other 3D formats
